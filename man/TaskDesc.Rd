\title{Description object for task.}
\description{
Description object for task, encapsulates basic properties of the task
without having to store the complete data set.
}
\details{
Object members:
\describe{
\item{id [\code{character(1)}]}{Id string of task.}
\item{type [\code{character(1)}]}{Type of task, \dQuote{classif} for classification,
  \dQuote{regr} for regression, \dQuote{surv} for survival and \dQuote{cluster} for
  cluster analysis, \dQuote{costsens} for cost-sensitive classification,
  \dQuote{multilabel} for multilabel classification and \dQuote{oneclass} for one-classification (anomaly detection).}
\item{target [\code{character(0)} | \code{character(1)} | \code{character(2)} | \code{character(n.classes)}]}{
  Name(s) of the target variable(s).
  For \dQuote{surv} these are the names of the survival time and event columns, so it has length 2.
  For \dQuote{costsens} it has length 0, as there is no target column, but a cost matrix instead.
  For \dQuote{multilabel} these are the names of logical columns that indicate whether a
  class label is present and the number of target variables corresponds to the number of
  classes.
  For \dQuote{oneclass} there is always a defined target column, so this is also \code{character(1)}
  (so supervised evaluation is possible for test sets).
  The denoted column is of type factor with two levels (\code{positive} (normal class) and
  \code{negative} (anomaly class)). The target column will be ignored during training.}
\item{size [\code{integer(1)}]}{Number of cases in data set.}
\item{n.feat [\code{integer(2)}]}{Number of features, named vector with entries:
  \dQuote{numerics}, \dQuote{factors}, \dQuote{ordered}.}
\item{has.missings [\code{logical(1)}]}{Are missing values present?}
\item{has.weights [\code{logical(1)}]}{Are weights specified for each observation?}
\item{has.blocking [\code{logical(1)}]}{Is a blocking factor for cases available in the task?}
\item{class.levels [\code{character}]}{All possible classes.
  Only present for \dQuote{classif}, \dQuote{costsens}, and \dQuote{multilabel}.}
\item{positive [\code{character(1)}]}{Only present for \dQuote{classif}, \dQuote{oneclass}.
 Positive class label for binary classification, NA for multiclass,
 normal class label for oneclass.}
\item{negative [\code{character(1)}]}{Only present for \dQuote{classif}, \dQuote{oneclass}.
  Negative class label for binary classification, NA for multiclass,
  anomaly class for oneclass.}
\item{censoring [\code{character(1)}]}{Censoring type for survival analysis.
  Only present for \dQuote{surv}, one of \dQuote{rcens} for right censored data,
  \dQuote{lcens} for left censored data, and \dQuote{icens} for interval censored
  data.}
