\title{Functional data regression task.}
\usage{
makeFDARegrTask(id = deparse(substitute(data)), data, target,
  weights = NULL, blocking = NULL, fixup.data = "warn",
  check.data = TRUE, fd.features = NULL, fd.grids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Id string for object.
Default is the name of the R variable passed to \code{data}.}

\item{data}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr
A data frame containing the features and target variable(s).}

\item{target}{[\code{character(1)} | \code{character(2)} | \code{character(n.classes)}]\cr
Name(s) of the target variable(s).
For survival analysis these are the names of the survival time and event columns,
so it has length 2. For multilabel classification it contains the names of the logical
columns that encode whether a label is present or not and its length corresponds to the
number of classes.}

\item{weights}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
Optional, non-negative case weight vector to be used during fitting.
Cannot be set for cost-sensitive learning.
Default is \code{NULL} which means no (= equal) weights.}

\item{blocking}{[\code{factor}]\cr
An optional factor of the same length as the number of observations.
Observations with the same blocking level \dQuote{belong together}.
Specifically, they are either put all in the training or the test set
during a resampling iteration.
Default is \code{NULL} which means no blocking.}

\item{fixup.data}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Should some basic cleaning up of data be performed?
Currently this means removing empty factor levels for the columns.
Possible choices are:
\dQuote{no} = Don't do it.
\dQuote{warn} = Do it but warn about it.
\dQuote{quiet} = Do it but keep silent.
Default is \dQuote{warn}.}

\item{check.data}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should sanity of data be checked initially at task creation?
You should have good reasons to turn this off (one might be speed).
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fd.features}{[Named \code{list} of \code{character} or \code{integer}]\cr
Optional. Functional features, as column indices or column names of the passed data.
The list names specify the names of the functional features.
Each list entry defines one functional feature through column names or indices.
Unreferenced columns are assumed to be scalar features.
Default is \code{NULL}, then we assume all columns to form one functional feature called \dQuote{fd1}.}

\item{fd.grids}{[\code{list} of \code{numeric}]\cr
Optional. Grids over which the functional features are observed.
Default is \code{NULL}, then all functional
features are observed on equidistant observation grids 1, 2, â€¦, <number of
observations per function>.}

\description{
Create a functional data regression task. This means that some features
in the task will be so-called functional covariates / functional features,
measured on a grid or time scale.

\examples{
dat = data.frame(matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 2))
dat$target = c(1,2)
# X1 to X5 is covariate 1 and X6 to X10 covariate 2
# grd specifies the time points the curves were sampled at.
grd = list(ch_1 = 1:5, ch_2 = 1:5)
# One row per Observation
tsk = makeFDARegrTask(data = dat, fd.features = list(ch_1 = 1:5, ch_2 = 6:10),
  target = "target", fd.grid = grd)
